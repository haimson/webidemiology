Using Yelp reviews to detect health code violations

This is very much a work in progress right now.

RESEARCH TEAM:
Oliver Haimson (ohaimson@uci.edu), Department of Informatics, UC Irvine;
John Schomberg, Department of Epidemiology, UC Irvine

PROBLEM: 
- Foodborne illness causes ~9.4 million foodborne illnesses each year
- Health departments have limited resources to assess restaurants

RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
- Can user-generated Yelp reviews be used to predict health code violations?
- How can large, publicly-available, online data be used as a sensor to address public health and epidemiological problems?
